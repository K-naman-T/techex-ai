// src/utils/rhubarb.js - Placeholder for potential specialized lip-sync logic
// For now, we will use a simpler frequency-based simulation in the Avatar component
// as implementing full phoneme-to-viseme mapping in browser JS without hefty libraries is complex.
// This file serves as a placeholder for future upgrades to libraries like 'rhubarb-lip-sync' or similar.

export const getVisemeFromAudio = (audioData) => {
  // Placeholder: In a real implementation, this would analyze the audio buffer
  // and return a specific viseme name (e.g., 'viseme_aa', 'viseme_O').
  return 'viseme_aa';
};
